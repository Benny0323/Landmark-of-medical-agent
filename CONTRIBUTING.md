# 🤝 Contributing
We sincerely welcome paper updates/ contributions of any kind (and please do that lol)! Feel free to *open issues* or *create pull requests*. <br> 

## Adding New Papers
If you want to add new papers to the existing list, please modify the README.md and follow the format in the table:

```markdown
| [Title of the Paper](Paper Link)  | [GitHub](GitHub Link)  | Year |
```
```markdown
| [Title of the Paper](Paper Link)  | [GitHub](GitHub Link) | Sections |
```

### Recommended Guidelines:
- Detect the earliest date of the paper, and place it properly in ascending order of the date.
- If possible, use arXiv links rather than links from other resources (e.g. conference page), and provide link to the *abstract* instead of PDF page..
- If the Github link is available, please add it; otherwise, use "Not Available" instead.
